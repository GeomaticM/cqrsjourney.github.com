## Contribution Guidelines

If you would like to become involved in the development of the CQRS Journey sample application and guidance, you can contribute in many different ways:

* We strongly value user feedback and appreciate your **questions, bug reports and feature requests**. For more details how you can submit these, see [Using the Sample Application, Reading the Documentation, and Providing Feedback](https://github.com/mspnp/cqrs-journey-code/blob/dev/README.markdown#sampleapp). 

* You can also **contribute changes to the code** (yes, [believe it](http://localhost:4000/blog/2012/02/25/Taking-Community-Contibutions/)!), which might include bug fixes and improvements as well as new features. See [Contributing Changes to the Code](https://github.com/mspnp/cqrs-journey-code/blob/dev/README.markdown#changecode).

* You can also **revise or propose new content for the guide**. See [Contributing Changes to the Guide](https://github.com/mspnp/cqrs-journey-code/blob/dev/README.markdown#changeguide).  

* You can provide **review comments to the draft guide**. We built a simple [document review site](http://pundit.cloudapp.net) which doesn't require using Git, GitHub, or Markdown. You can simply see the docs with inline comments of others and submit your own commentary. Please note that this site only shows the latest version of the docs. As the new versions of the docs are produced and the comments are acted upon, the comments are removed from the pages but remain visible via the history of check-ins in the [main document repository](https://github.com/mspnp/cqrs-journey-doc).
