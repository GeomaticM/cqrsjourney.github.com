## Who
The [Microsoft patterns & practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices) team is a group of engineers (developers, testers, program managers), designers, and technical writers who produce guidance to help the larger community build solutions. With this project, we hope to provide you with a map that will help you to find your own way with the Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES) patterns and related techniques.

## What
There will be two, closely related, deliverables from this project: the source code for a complete, working reference implementation (an end-to-end sample app) that illustrates the key concepts, patterns, and approaches related to CQRS & ES, and a written guide to accompany the code, provide explanations, context, and references to other relevant material.

The reference implementation will be a conference management system that you will be able to easily deploy and run in your own environment. This will enable you to explore and experiment with a realistic application built following a CQRS-based approach.

## Principles
 - This project values open, standards-based development
 - We value the great work already available from others and intend to thank existing thought-leaders through attribution
 - This work should happen in the open so everyone is able to follow along
 - We would like to help foster a community of practice and build consensus within the community
 - This project represents a conversation not a dictation
 - We would like to meet the community where it is - using what it's using
 - The guidance should be based on the best thinking available but also the scenarios customers care about
 
## How
We hire experts, developers, testers, and writers to augment our team of full-time employees to build these deliverables. We do so using agile/Scrum team practices that operate on fortnightly sprints. At the end of each sprint we hold calls with a group of advisors to demo the new stuff, discuss decision points, and get feedback on our direction. This feedback is crucial to our success.
